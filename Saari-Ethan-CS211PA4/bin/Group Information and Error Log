Errors:
On Ethan's computer, CircuitTests.java returned
	one failure, circuit_getCircuitScanner, which
	was not returned on Zach's computer. This was 
	assumed to be a glitch on Ethan's computer, as
	the code should have been fully working, and 
	screenshots of the tests from Zach's computer
	have been provided.
